# Welcome to Valorant Match Tracker!

This is a project created for the javascript_project portion of the App Academy Curriculum. However, it's been created with the intent of one day expanding it into a full application. It's been made by an actual Valorant player (Act 2 - present: Immortal) with the insight of somebody who knows what information is useful for those who wish to improve at the game.

* With this app, users will be able to:
    + Select a specific player or all players in the match to view their stats
    + Cycle through the rounds of a match and view a dynamically updating map containing the locations of the selected player's kill victims for that round.
    + Cycle through the rounds of a match and view a dynamically updating map containing the locations of the selected player's deaths for that round.
    + Use a selector to decide which locations to view or all.
    + Select a weapon from a list displayed to the side of the map containing the weapons used to kill during the round (could be an empty list). The map will display only deaths to that weapon or kills with that weapon.
    + View their overall combat score/economy stats for the round.

* In addition, this project will include:
    + Instructions for use
    + README.md file
    + A sample database provided by a user with access to Riot's restricted Valorant API

## Future Implementations:

Utilize this app as the view page for a larger project in which a user selects/searches for a list of another user's match history, and then selects a single match to view in greater detail.
