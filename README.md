# Welcome to Valorant Match Tracker!

With this app, users will be able to:
    - Cycle through the rounds of a match and view a dynamically updating map containing the locations of their kill victims for that round.
    - Cycle through the rounds of a match and view a dynamically updating map containing the locations of their deaths for that round.
    - Use a selector to decide which locations to view or all.
    - Select a weapon from a list displayed to the side of the map containing the weapons used to kill during the round (could be an empty list). The map will display only deaths to that weapon or kills with that weapon.
    - View their overall combat score/economy stats for the round.

In addition, this project will include:
    - Instructions for use
    - README.md file
    - A sample database provided by a user with access to Riot's restricted Valorant API

Future Implementations:
Utilize this app as the view page for a larger project in which a user selects/searches for a list of another user's match history, and then selects a single match to view in greater detail.
